# Project-1: Automatically display NJTRANSIT train departure times.
#### Author: Kieyn Parks
#### Language: Python
#### Database: MongoDB (NoSQL)

This project is a combination the following:
- Engineering and Design
- Database
- Data Structures and Algorithms 

## Project Overview:

This project is in two parts. The first part is the database managment system (DBMS) for a NoSQL database and the second part is the user interface (UI). The DBMS impliments CRUD functionallity for Inserting, deleting, update, and searching of the database. The U.I. interfaces with the user and displays information to the screen.

## User Interface discription:

This application is designed to return the train schedule for New Jersey Transit train system from the database to the user. The goal is that the entire process happens automatically using the GPS location of the user. Once the application is opened the GPS location is grabed from the user's device. The GPS coordinates is used to determine the closest train station to the user with the next 4 departure times going in each direction; this is the top use case for this application. The second use case will be trip planning.

Trip planning is a bit more complicated as it requres the user to input some information, nameley trip starting point and trip ending point no train staion name is neccessary just the town name and the program will workout closest stations possible including all connections to complete the trip.

## Algorithm and Data Structure:
Python offers sevral data structures.
- List
- Sets
- Accosiative Array/ Dictionary / Maps
- Tuples

The main data structure used in this programs is a **list of tuples** This contains the the name of the stations, the station IDs and the latitude and Longitude coordinates of each  Train station. Keeping a data structure with this information

**Example of the list of tuples.**
```
jersey_coast_line2 = [('Aberdeen Matawan Station', 'AM',  [40.420161,-74.223702]), ('Allenhurst Station','AH', [40.237659,-74.006769]), ('Asbury Park Station',
'AP', [40.215359,-74.014782]),  ('Avenel Station','AV', [40.577620,-74.277530]),('Bay Head Station','BH', [40.077178,-74.046201]),
('Belmar Station','BS', [40.180590,-74.027301]),  ('Bradley Beach Station','BB', [40.203753,-74.018891]), ('Elberon Station','EL',[40.265292,-73.997617]),
('Elizabeth Station','EZ', [40.667859,-74.215171]), ('Hazlet Station','HZ', [40.415385,-74.190393]), ('Little Silver Station','LS', [40.326715,-74.041054]),
('Manasquan Station','SQ', [40.120573,-74.047685]), ('Middletown New Jersey Station','MI', [40.389780,-74.116131]), ('Monmouth Park Station','MK', [40.313427,-74.015172]),
('New York Penn Station','NY', [40.750051,-73.992358]), ('Newark Penn Station','NP', [40.734223,-74.164550]), ('Perth Amboy Station','PE', [40.509398,-74.273752]),
('Point Pleasant Beach Station','PP', [40.092718,-74.048191]), ('Red Bank Station','RB', [40.348284,-74.074535]), ('Secaucus Junction Station','SE', [40.761190,-74.075821]),
('South Amboy Station','CH', [40.48431,-74.28014]), ('Spring Lake Station','LA', [40.150559,-74.035481]), ('Linden Station','LI', [40.629487,-74.251772]),
('Long Branch Station','LB', [40.297145,-73.988331]), ('Woodbridge Station','WB', [40.55661,-74.27775]), ('EWR Newark Airport Station','NA', [40.704417,-74.190714])]
```
Another data structure used in this project is **Python Dictionary.**

**Example of python Dictionary**
This dictionary is used to convert 2 digit military time (type: "text") to  military (type: Integer)
```
time_map_local = {'00':0, '01':1, '02':2, '03':3, '04':4, '05':5, '06':6, '07':7, '08':8,
                  '09':9, '10':10, '11':11, '12':12, '13':13, '14':14, '15':15, '16':16, '17':17,
                  '18':18, '19':19, '20':20, '21':21, '22':22, '23':23}

```
